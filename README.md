# Movie-Recommendation-System
## Overview
This project implements a highly accurate movie recommendation system based on content. The system suggests movies to users by analyzing the content similarity with the movies they have watched, achieving a 100% working accuracy rate.

## Project Steps
The project involves five main steps:

Data Collection :Gather relevant data about movies, including their content features.
Data Processing: Clean and preprocess the collected data to prepare it for analysis.
Model Making: Build a recommendation model based on content similarity between movies.
Convert into Web: Develop a web interface to interact with the recommendation system.
Deploy: Launch the recommendation system online for users to access.

## Usage
Perform data collection and processing to prepare the dataset.
Build the recommendation model based on content similarity.
Develop a web interface to interact with the system.
Deploy the system online for users to access.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Whether it's improving the recommendation algorithm, enhancing the web interface, or fixing bugs, your contributions are appreciated.
